                    <p class="details">
                        Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J.K. Rowling. The series follows the life of a young orphan boy named Harry Potter, who discovers that he is a wizard and attends the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn magic.<br>                            
                        J.K. Rowling was born in England in 1965 and began writing the Harry Potter series in 1990. She has a background in English and French literature and worked as a researcher and bilingual secretary before becoming a full-time writer. Rowling's personal experiences, including her struggles with depression, poverty, and the death of her mother, have influenced her writing.<br>
                        Rowling's writing style in the Harry Potter series is characterized by vivid descriptions, intricate plotlines, and a strong emphasis on character development. She creates a richly detailed and immersive world, filled with magical creatures, spells, and objects. Rowling's prose is generally straightforward and accessible, but she also incorporates elements of humor and suspense to keep readers engaged.<br>
                        The Harry Potter series is written in third-person limited point of view, meaning that the narrative is told from the perspective of Harry Potter or another character, but the reader only has access to that character's thoughts and feelings. This technique allows readers to identify closely with the characters and experience the story through their eyes.<br>
                        Overall, Rowling's writing style in the Harry Potter series is engaging, imaginative, and emotionally resonant. The series has become a cultural phenomenon, beloved by millions of readers worldwide, and its influence on popular culture and children's literature cannot be overstated.<br>

In subsequent books, Harry continues his education at Hogwarts while facing many challenges, including battles against Voldemort and his followers, the Death Eaters.<br>
                        Throughout the series, Harry develops close friendships with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, who help him navigate the dangers of the wizarding world. Along the way, Harry also encounters many other memorable characters, both good and bad.<br>
                        The Harry Potter series is known for its intricate plotlines, vivid descriptions of magical creatures and places, and its themes of love, friendship, and the struggle between good and evil.

                    </p>
                    <p class="details">
                        The Harry Potter series explores a wide range of themes that are relevant to readers of all ages. Here are some of the key themes explored in the books:<br><br>
                        <b>Love and Friendship:</b> One of the most prominent themes in the Harry Potter series is the importance of love and friendship. Harry, Ron, and Hermione's bond is a strong one that is tested repeatedly throughout the series. Their friendship provides them with the support they need to overcome obstacles and face danger.<br>
                        <b>Good vs. Evil:</b> The struggle between good and evil is another central theme in the Harry Potter series. Harry and his friends are pitted against the dark wizard Voldemort and his followers, the Death Eaters. The series explores the complex nature of morality and the idea that individuals have the power to choose between good and evil.<br>
                        <b>Courage and Bravery:</b> Courage and bravery are important themes in the Harry Potter series. Harry and his friends must confront many dangerous situations throughout the books, and they often display great courage in the face of danger.<br>

                    </p>
                    <p class="details">
                       J.K. Rowling is a highly accomplished author with several successful books, but her Harry Potter series is undoubtedly her most popular and successful work. 
                       It is difficult to compare her other books with it. "The Casual Vacancy" is a departure from the fantasy genre of Harry Potter and is a more realistic exploration of social issues in a small English town. 
                       "The Cuckoo's Calling," written under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith, is a mystery novel that received positive reviews but did not reach the same level of popularity as Harry Potter. "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" is a companion to the Harry Potter series, presenting itself as a textbook used by students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, providing additional information on the magical creatures featured in the Harry Potter universe.
                        Overall, while these books showcase Rowling's writing abilities in different genres, none of them have achieved the same level of success as the Harry Potter series.
